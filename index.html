    <p class="back">Attack on Democracy
        The Story
        It's been one year since the January 6th attack.

        Walk me through it.
        For months, then-President Trump had worked to undermine the outcome of the 2020 presidential election. But on
        January 6, 2021, Congress gathered to certify President Biden's victory. And around 2:15pm ET, a mob of
        pro-Trump protesters breached the US Capitol. They scaled walls, shattered windows, broke into federal offices,
        and stole furniture. Capitol Police tried to uphold order. But lawmakers still feared for their safety. Some
        were evacuated. Others barricaded themselves inside their offices and hid under desks. Five people died and
        dozens were injured. It was the first major attack on the Capitol since 1814.</p>
